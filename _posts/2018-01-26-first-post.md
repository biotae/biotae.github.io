#Increased Sleep Homeostasis Response and Shortened Circadian Period in the Cereblon Knockout Mouse Model


##Abstract
###Introduction
Accumulative studies have suggested that sleep plays an important role in energy conservation. Hence, changes in energy regulation may also affect the normal physiology of sleep. Cereblon (CRBN), known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target of thalidomide, downregulates the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which serves as a major energy sensor. However, the impact of CRBN on sleep-wake control has not been investigated yet. Therefore, we hypothesized that CRBN might be necessary for maintaining a normal sleep-wake behavior and circadian rhythm and sought to elucidate the role of CRBN using CRBN knockout (KO) mice.
###Methods
We implanted electrodes for electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) to 3-month-old CRBN KO and control mice (n=___, ___, respectively). A 24-hour baseline recording followed by 6-hour sleep deprivation by gentle handling protocol and 6-hour recovery sleep was performed. Activity wheel-based circadian rhythms for 3 weeks were quantified using circadian recording system. The light/dark condition consisted of 1 week in 12/12 hour light/dark cycle followed 2 weeks in constant dark condition. Sleep was analyzed with Sirenia software (Pinnacle Technology) and circadian rhythm with ClockLab Analysis(version 6, Actimetrics)
###Rseults
Baseline sleep finding: sleep amount, bout analysis, power spectrum
Recovery sleep finding: sleep amount, bout analysis, power spectrum
Circadian finding: amplitude, period, bout analysis

Through a 36-hour sleep analysis, we found that a slow wave activity (SWA) in a recovery sleep state significantly increased in a CRBN KO mice, compared to the wild type mice. In addition, in a circadian recording experiment, we found that circadian period of the CRBN KO mouse group decreased in a dark/dark cycle.

###Conclusion
The enhanced sleep homeostasis can be explained by AMPK, which is a potential target for CRBN. CRBN KO may induce overexpression of AMPK, resulting in a generation of ATP. Break down of ATP will make adenosine, which has a sleep inducing effect. This may extend a duration of sleep behavior. Contradictorily, an activation of AMPK can lengthen or shorten circadian period. However, it is clear that AMPK activation is related to molecular clock gene expression. This relationship should be investigated more in a next study.
